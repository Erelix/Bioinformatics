How did the Covid-19 evolve, what path through hosts was taken?
Path: 
Camels -> Bats -> Humans
1. Dromedary Camel coronavirus (MN514967.1)
2. Various Bat coronavirus strands
3. SARS coronavirus 2 (NC_045512)

2. Would it be different interpretation if out-group is not used?
Yes, you wouldn't be abe to tell which virsues evolved from witch. 
Now it's clear Camel -> Bats -> Humans.

3. What about Urbani SARS origin? 
Ammm... Well.. My tree doesn't iclude Urbani SARS, just SARS coronavirus 2.
However, according to research, Urbani SARS originated from bats -> palm civets -> humans, 
which is a different evolutionary pathway than SARS coronavirus 2.

4. Is the Palm Civet origin evident?
No, palm civet origin is not evident in this analysis. 
My tree shows SARS coronavirus 2 clustering directly with 
bat coronaviruses without any palm civet sequences.
